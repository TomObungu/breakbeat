1. Go back and edify the written notes for the sections of code screenshots
2. Remove the pseudocode descriptions from design and move them to describe the development of the code screenshots
3. Practice computational thinking approaches to the writing my program and use them continue development of the main menu.
	
	Features to add:
		- Transition game state
			-> Fade to black transition via the GPU using a shader or via the CPU by program code 
				-> Darkening the texture coordinates on screen
					-> Use the darkening shader momentarily
		- Input handling for each game state
			-> Switch/if chains within the update() loop 
				-> If game state == to GAME_MENU then draw the text as yellow using GUIRenderer class
					-> Alternate between texture
					-> Listen for key press events
						-> If pressed enter then change game state accordingly and perform transition animation if needed 
		- Create unbind texture subroutine (probably the easier option) or figure out bindless textures
			-> Unbind and "switch" textures (more expensive) bind slots with other textures that are currently being used
